    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is the “Card Payment Chain”?</h2>
      <p>
        When you pay with a credit card, several organizations cooperate to move information and money.
        Together they form the <strong>card payment chain</strong>. At a high level it includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>you, the <strong>cardholder</strong>,</li>
        <li>the <strong>merchant</strong> and their payment terminal or checkout,</li>
        <li>the merchant’s <strong>acquirer</strong> and payment gateway/processor,</li>
        <li>the card <strong>network</strong> (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, Amex), and</li>
        <li>your <strong>issuer</strong> (the bank or provider behind the card account).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each link in the chain adds something: connectivity, risk checks, routing, compliance and
        settlement. They also each take a slice of the merchant fee, which is why understanding
        the chain matters to both merchants and issuers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Actors -->
    <section id="actors" class="section">
      <h2>The Main Actors in the Chain</h2>
      <p>
        Different players have distinct roles and economics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Merchant:</strong> accepts card payments and pays a fee on each transaction.
          Wants reliability, low costs and quick settlement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Acquirer:</strong> the merchant’s bank or payment provider. Onboards merchants,
          manages risk and connects to the networks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment gateway / processor:</strong> provides the technical connection between
          the merchant’s checkout and the acquirer/network, handling encryption and routing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Card network:</strong> defines rules, formats, fees and runs the scheme that
          links issuers and acquirers globally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Issuer:</strong> provides the card, extends credit and decides whether to approve
          or decline each authorization.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some companies combine several roles (for example, a provider acting as both gateway and
        acquirer). Others specialize in one layer of the chain only.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Flow -->
    <section id="flow" class="section">
      <h2>From Tap to Settlement: How the Chain Flows</h2>
      <p>
        A standard credit-card transaction typically moves through three stages:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Authorization:</strong> when you tap or insert the card, the terminal sends
          an encrypted request through the gateway to the acquirer, across the network and to the issuer.
          The issuer checks available credit, fraud signals and rules, then returns approve/decline.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clearing:</strong> approved transactions are later sent in batches from acquirers
          to networks and onward to issuers with more complete data, ready for posting on statements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Settlement:</strong> money moves between institutions (often via the network)
          so that issuers reimburse acquirers, and acquirers pay merchants minus agreed fees.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This flow usually completes in one to two business days, although the cardholder may only
        see it as a cleared transaction on their statement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Fees & economics -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Where Fees Live in the Chain</h2>
      <p>
        The price a merchant pays per transaction is typically broken into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Interchange:</strong> goes to the issuer, meant to cover credit risk, fraud and
          account servicing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scheme/network fees:</strong> go to the card network for operating the rails
          and running rule frameworks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Acquirer margin and processing fees:</strong> cover the acquirer’s own risk,
          support, and any gateway/technology services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Different card types and regions have different fee caps, rules and negotiation options,
        which is why the same chain can be more or less expensive depending on where and how you accept cards.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Risk & security -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Risk, Security & Compliance Along the Chain</h2>
      <p>
        Every link in the chain has obligations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Data security:</strong> card data must be handled according to scheme rules and
          standards like PCI DSS.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fraud monitoring:</strong> issuers, acquirers and processors all run fraud models
          and monitoring to detect unusual patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compliance & KYC:</strong> customer and merchant onboarding are subject to
          local regulations, sanctions rules and network policies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Modern stacks use tokenization, 3-D Secure, risk-based authentication and network tokens
        to make this chain more secure without adding too much friction to each purchase.
