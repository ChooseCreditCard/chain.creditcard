    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Chain-Based Card?</h2>
      <p>
        A “chain card” links a standard Visa or Mastercard to funds stored on a blockchain. Instead of pulling money from a bank account, the issuer checks an on-chain or custodial wallet, converts value to fiat, and settles the merchant transaction through the card network.
      </p>
      <p>
        For merchants nothing changes — payouts arrive in local currency. All blockchain interaction happens on the issuer side, which handles liquidity, conversion and settlement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- MECHANICS -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Chain-to-Card Bridges Work</h2>
      <p>
        When a user taps their card, the card network requests authorisation. A backend service evaluates the user’s chain balance, checks token or stablecoin holdings, and either:
      </p>
      <p>
        • converts crypto to fiat instantly,  
        • draws from a prefunded fiat pool synced with on-chain assets, or  
        • performs a hybrid model where stablecoins back internal ledgers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The settlement the merchant receives always occurs in standard fiat, even if the user spent assets originally stored on-chain.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- FEES -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Conversion Costs, Spreads & Blockchain Fees</h2>
      <p>
        Chain-based card systems often involve several layers of cost: network gas fees, conversion spreads, liquidity slippage, and standard card-related fees such as FX margins. Understanding all layers is essential to estimating the total cost of using blockchain-backed cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some programmes hide spreads inside conversion quotes, so published “0% fees” may still mask meaningful costs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- REWARDS -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Rewards & Incentive Structures</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on the provider, rewards may be earned in fiat, points, or blockchain-based tokens. Token rewards can look attractive, but their value depends on volatility, liquidity and redemption terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some chain programmes reward users for staking assets or locking liquidity, which increases exposure to protocol risk.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- RISK -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Risk, Volatility & Regulatory Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Converting blockchain assets into fiat can trigger tax events, depending on the jurisdiction. Using a chain-backed card day-to-day may generate numerous small disposals requiring documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regulatory clarity varies widely. Chain issuers may fall under e-money, payment-processor or crypto-asset rules — each with different obligations for safeguarding and consumer protection.
