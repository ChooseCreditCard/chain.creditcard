    <!-- What is the payment chain? -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What is a “payment chain” in card payments?</h2>
      <p class="small">
        A payment chain is the full path your card transaction takes from the cardholder to the merchant’s
        bank account and back – including all the intermediaries that touch the data and the money flow.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        Even a “simple” card payment usually involves five core parties:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Cardholder</strong> – the person using the card.</li>
        <li><strong>Merchant</strong> – the business accepting the payment.</li>
        <li><strong>Acquirer</strong> – the merchant’s bank or PSP.</li>
        <li><strong>Card network</strong> – Visa, Mastercard, Amex, local schemes, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Issuer</strong> – the bank or fintech that issued the card.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        The payment chain describes how these parties connect, how messages travel between them and
        where fees, chargebacks, risk checks and delays enter the picture.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How it works -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How a card payment moves through the chain</h2>
      <p class="small">
        While implementations vary between providers, most card payments follow a similar high-level flow:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>1. Capture</strong> – the card details are captured via terminal, POS, wallet or online checkout.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Authorization request</strong> – the acquirer sends an auth request along the network to the issuer.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Risk &amp; controls</strong> – issuer checks balance, limits, fraud signals, 3DS/SCA rules and more.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Auth response</strong> – approved or declined, plus codes that explain why.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Clearing &amp; batching</strong> – approved transactions are grouped and sent for clearing.</li>
        <li><strong>6. Interchange &amp; scheme fees</strong> – card network and issuer fees are calculated.</li>
        <li><strong>7. Settlement</strong> – funds are moved between banks and arrive in the merchant’s payout account.</li>
        <li><strong>8. Post-transaction events</strong> – refunds, chargebacks or disputes may travel back along the chain.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Merchants and fintechs rarely see all of this directly, but small changes in any link of the chain
        can have a visible effect on approval rates, costs and customer experience.
      </p>

    <!-- Types / models -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Different chain models in card payments</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Not all payment chains look the same. Depending on the scheme and setup, the structure can change:
      </p>

      <div class="cluster-grid">
        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Four-party schemes</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Classic card model with separate issuer and acquirer connected via an open network
            (e.g. Visa, Mastercard). Common for most debit and credit cards.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Three-party schemes</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Card, issuer and acquirer are controlled by the same brand (e.g. some Amex or store cards),
            simplifying the chain but limiting reach.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Aggregator / PSP models</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Payment service providers bundle acquiring, routing and risk, adding an extra node in the chain
            while simplifying integration for merchants.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>On-us vs off-us</h3>
          <p class="small">
            When issuer and acquirer are the same bank (“on-us”), processing can be faster and cheaper.
            Off-us requires external clearing and more hops.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Card-present vs CNP</h3>
          <p class="small">
            In-store chip &amp; PIN / tap vs. online or in-app payments. Card-not-present (CNP) adds extra
            risk checks and often 3DS/SCA into the chain.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Wallet &amp; tokenized chains</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Apple Pay, Google Pay and other wallets insert tokenization and wallet providers into the chain,
            improving security and changing how data flows.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Fees / Risks / Limits table -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Where fees, risks and limits appear in the chain</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Each link in the chain can introduce cost, risk controls and limits. Understanding where they sit
        helps explain why a transaction is expensive, slow or declined.
